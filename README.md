# Pandas-and-TFIDF
Aim of this project is to check for TFIDF for a word in each document. I implemented this code for a NLP project where the first rule was to pick the document which is more relevant to the word entered.

Implementing TFIDF using sklearn was not of much use to me because I needed to keep a track of the document names. 

Implemented TFIDF using Pandas Dataframe.
